	<h1> My hobbies </h1>
	<h2> My hobbies vary as my parents have advised me to try more things, but I do have something that I really like to do. </h2>
    <h2> Exercising </h2>
	<h3> I have exercised since Grade 11. I really enjoy the feeling of getting my body stronger to protect myself better, and I always do exercises at different places. </h3>
  <h3> Exercising was stopped by myself at the beginning of Grade 12, but now I have started it again these days. </h3>

	<h2> Listening to the music </h2>
	<h3> I really like to listen to the music. </h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjbUCd"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjbUCd.jpg" alt="gjbUCd.jpg" border="0" /></a>

     <h3> Although I may not have listened to a lot of songs, I really like some of the singers, like Pushu and YOASOBI. </h3>

  <h3> Therefore, I will download their songs to my computer and play them many times. </h3>
    

  <h1> Games </h1>
	<h2> I think that a person has to relax after studying very hard, so I would like to talk about some games that I would like to play. Hope you have the same interest with me. </h2> 
	
	<h2> Genshin Impact </h2>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjxjYT"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjxjYT.png" alt="gjxjYT.png" border="0" /></a>
	<h3> A recently very famous game. The difficulty of it is not very high and we can enjoy the beautiful scenery in this game. </h3>
  <h3> I only sometimes play it because I may lose myself in this game. It is too perfect except for the unreasonable character-raising system. </h3>

  <h2> Arena of Valor </h2>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjxXkV"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjxXkV.jpg" alt="gjxXkV.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  <h3> Arena of Valor is one of the world-famous games. A lot of people play it. The MOBA system and fighting are wonderful for me. </h3>
  <h3> However, after playing the game long, I find that it is getting boring if we do not play with our friends. </h3>
  <h3> The balance among characters in this game is very good thought.</h3>

  <h1> Travelling </h1>

  <h2> Travelling in Europe </h2>
  <h3> Studying in the UK makes it much easier to travel in Europe, so I also spent some time travelling in the European countries I like. </h3>

  <h3> The Netherlands was an artistic country and the scenery there seemed to be that described in a dreamworld. </h3>

  <h1> Volunteering  </h1>
  <h2> I will sometimes volunteer to both earn volunteer hours and meet more people. </h2>
	<h3> The most interesting volunteering experiences are about going to football fields with Sally and Allison. </h3> 
  <h3> I really love to volunteer for Sally. Although she might sometimes be too worried about our abilities, she is absolutely a good leader that could manage all the things perfectly. </h3>
